# Server

The server has multiple functions out of which they are:

* Reading config file

* Calling stock API

* Sending email to user

The server uses an .env file in its directory for confidential resources such as API keys and emails

The config.json is a configuration file for setting the notification time and the stocks which the app should follow. The default config file should not be taken as financial advice.
